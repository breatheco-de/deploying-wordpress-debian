# `06` Validate your installation

If you have already managed to view your website you are ready to validate your installation. This step is to run a verification script to validate what is requested in this practice, to do this follow these steps:

## 1. Run the validation script `validate-wordpress-site.sh`.

Once you have run the script to see it work, and added it to the cron jobs, it is time to validate.

Inside this repo, under the `.learn/assets` folder you will find a `validate-wordpress-site.sh` bash script. Run the script by typing the following command:

```bash
bash .learn/assets/validate-wordpress-site.sh
```

## 2. Run the test

Once the script is successfully executed, you will be able to run the test to validate your Windows installation in VirtualBox.
